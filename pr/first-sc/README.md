## Release

On Jan. 31, 2015, at 12:55 p.m. in Hong Kong's Central District, a group of pioneering technology and law experts came together to execute a legally binding, enforceable smart contract business agreement following formal procedures.

### Execution

BitQuant Research Laboratories (Asia) Ltd. Director, Dr Joseph Wang, proudly signed the digitally drafted agreement with AirButton's CEO Oswis Wong. "This smart contract came about through several months of collaboration with CryptoLaw, including both technical effort and legal research," said Dr Wang. "We are very passionate about this new technology -- it's only a matter of time until it revolutionizes how people do business."

The smart contract in question is that of a business loan from BitQuant to AirButton, the terms of which can be seen on GitHub.com. It was an open source project. [1] 

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are not a new idea in academia, but had yet to be adopted by businesses because of technological hurdles. "Smart contracts were only theorized in computer science academic circles and had not been properly examined by lawyers or law professors," said Samuel Bourque, an academic legal researcher at the City University of Hong Kong. Bourque, with a background in technology, finance and law, has authored peer-reviewed journal articles on the topics of bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts that bridge the divide between the intricate technologies and the legal profession.

Smart contracts, as defined in recent peer-reviewed literature, must meet three criteria: (i) some level of automation; (ii) its authoritative version is drafted in machine-interpretable code; and (iii) it is processed in a way that is not within the exclusive control of either party. [2]

### BitQuant

In collaboration with CryptoLaw, Dr. Wang wrote the smart contract signed in January as a standalone piece of JavaScript code that runs in any browser. "I went out of my way to get agreement all-around to make [the smart contract] open source so that others can help make future iterations better," said Dr Wang. "The smart contract will automate the processing of the loan, so that I don't have to -- that's the best way to make it scale."

Dr. Wang, as founder of BitQuant [3], is working on new ways to revolutionize financial technology and remedy inefficiencies in capital allocation: "Most loans are made to those who do not need them; those who need them most, risk-taking entrepreneurs, are largely shunned by big banks. The innovation funds and grants help, but still leave a big gap." 

### AirButton

Dr. Wang saw a need for such an extension of credit in AirButton, a Hong Kong based technology startup. "We are building state-of-the-art near field communications-based technology devices that interact with smartphones, as an example, to enhance user experience," said Oswis Wong, CEO of AirButton. "Our first product that we are launching is a customizable set of extra buttons that act as shortcuts to your favorite, or most used, applications." AirButton has gained positive attention since it was selected in 2014 as a Cyberport incubatee.

### CryptoLaw

CryptoLaw [4] is a technology services firm that specializes in regulatory advice for technology startups, and -- most particularly -- smart contracts. Also selected as an incubatee by Cyberport, CryptoLaw is "working on building enterprise-level smart contract tools for legally binding agreements throughout the whole life cycle of the agreement -- from drafting to completion, including exceptional cases such as arbitration and court evidentiary procedures," said Samuel Bourque, speaking for CryptoLaw. "[CryptoLaw's] flagship product, NScrypt, is an integrated development environment for drafting smart contracts that are as flexible as your business needs -- it'll be in private Beta soon. Expect it to be released in 2015 Q2.".

### Legalities

"Smart contracts are legally binding... if drafted properly," cautions Mr. Yu, a senior corporate lawyer, "a lot of care needs to go into them to ensure that statutory requirements are met." Once drafted and signed, the prevailing jurisprudential consensus is that they are legally binding and enforceable in courts; however, this has yet to be tested. Bourque underscores that, "Smart contracts do not change the nature of the role of contracts in business or in law; they rather introduce a better means of reducing friction throughout the process. The laws are not yet set in stone, but all principles of law point favorably to their enforceability."

### Enthusiasm

Since the advent of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, there has been a growing amount of attention on smart contracts, most notably on the Ethereum project, which has yet to launch despite having purportedly raised upwards of US$15 million.

"We love the idea of Ethereum," said Bourque, "however, we're concerned about the disconnect between the technology and the legal system, in that engineers are used to work being rather distant from legal realities. You cannot ignore business and legal implications." Ethereum and other similar projects tie blockchain technology and smart contracts, raising several legal issues that are unclear for the legal systems around the world.

### World First?

During the signing ceremony, the group wondered whether they were the first ever to execute a properly formed, legally binding, business smart contract agreement. "I put word out there on various cryptocurrency forums, asking whether there were any other who made the claim,” said Dr. Wang. “That was two months ago... nobody has popped up to make the claim."

The group is, however, confident in claiming to be the first in Hong Kong to execute a smart contract according to formal legal standards. 

When asked why they signed it on paper rather than cryptographically, Dr. Wang said: "Sometimes we appreciate the low-tech exercise of meeting up in person, shaking hands and signing it the old fashioned way. Besides, we pushed the boundaries of technology enough for today."
