## Title

**World's First Smart Contract?**

## Abstract

The first legally binding, enforceable Smart Contract business agreement has been signed in the CryptoLaw office on January 31 2015 at 12:55PM in Hong Kong's Central District. In attendance were the parties: Dr Joseph Wang, on behalf on BitQuant, and Oswis Wong, on behalf of AirButton; as well as Samuel Bourque, an academic researcher and Mr. Yu, a solicitor. This event promises to usher in a new era that brings automation to business contracts.

## Release

On January 31 2015 at 12:55PM in Hong Kong's Central District, a group of pioneering technology and legal experts came together to execute a legally binding, enforceable Smart Contract business agreement following formal legal procedures.

### Execution

BitQuant Research Laboratories (Asia) Ltd. Director, Dr Joseph Wang, proudly signed the digitally drafted agreement with AirButton's CEO, Oswis Wong. "This Smart Contract came about through several months of collaboration with CryptLaw, including both technical effort and legal research," said Dr Wang, "we are very passionate about this new technology--it's only a matter of time until it revolutionizes how people do business."

The Smart Contract in question is that of a business loan from BitQuant to AirButton, the terms of which are plainly viewable on GitHub.com, as it was an open source project. [1] 

### Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts are not a new idea in academia, but have not seen adoption in business, as there were historically many technological hurdles preventing it. "Smart Contracts were only theorized in Computer Science academic circles and not properly examined by neither lawyers, nor law professors," said Samuel Bourque, an academic legal researcher at the City University of Hong Kong. Bourque, with technology, finance and legal backgrounds, has authored peer-reviewed journal articles on the topic of Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts--bridging the divide between the intricate technologies and the legal profession.

The accepted definition of a Smart Contract, as established in the recent peer-reviewed literature, must meet three criteria: (i) that is has some level of automation; (ii) that its authoritative version is drafted in machine-interpretable code; and (iii) that it processed in a way that is not within the exclusive control of either party. [2]

### BitQuant

In collaboration with CryptoLaw, Dr. Wang wrote the trailblazing Smart Contract as a stand-alone piece of JavaScript code, that runs in any browser. "I went out of my way to get agreement all-around to make [the Smart Contract] open source so that others can help make future iterations better" said Dr Wang, "The Smart Contract will automate the processing of the loan, so that I don't have to--that's the best way to make it scale."

Dr Wang, as founder of BitQuant [3], is working on new ways to revolutionize fintech and remedy how capital gets inefficiently allocated: "most loans are made to those who do not need it; those who need it most, the risk-taking entrepreneurs, are largely shunned by the big banks. The innovation funds and grants help, but still leave a great divide." 

### AirButton

Dr Wang saw a need for such an extension of credit in AirButton, a Hong Kong based technology start-up. "We are building state-of-the-art Near Field Communications (NFC) based technology devices, that interact with smart phone, as an example, to enhance the user experience," said Oswis Wong, CEO of AirButton, "our first product that we are launching is a customizable set of extra buttons that act as shortcuts to your favorite, or must used, applications." AirButton has gained a good amount of positive attention since it was selected as an incubatee in Cyberport in 2014.

### CryptoLaw

CryptoLaw [4] is a legal-related, technology services firm that specializes in regulatory advice for technolofy startups, and--most particularly--Smart Contracts. Also selected as an incubatee by Cyberport, "we are working on building enterprise-level Smart Contract tools for legally binding agreements throughout the whole life cycle of the agreement--from drafting to completion, including exceptional cases such as arbitration and court evidentiary procedures" said Sam, co-founder of CryptoLaw.

"[CryptoLaw's] flagship product, NScrypt, is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for drafting Smart Contracts that are as flexible as your business needs--it is expected to be released in 2015 Q2" according to their website.

### Legalities

"Smart Contracts are legally binding... if drafted properly," cautions Henry, co-founder of CryptoLaw, "a lot of care needs to go into them to ensure that statutory requirements are met." Once drafted and signed, the prevailing legal consensus is that they are legally binding and enforceable in courts; however, this has yet to be tested in courts. Bourque underscores that "Smart Contracts do not change the nature of contracts' role in business or in law; they rather introduce better means of reducing friction throughout the process. The laws are not yet set in stone, but all principles of law point favorably to their enforceability."

### Enthusiasm

Since the advent of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies, there has been a growing amount of attention on Smart Contracts, most notably on the Ethereum project, which has yet to launch despite having purportedly raised upwards of US$15M.

"We love the idea of Ethereum," said Sam, "however we're concerned about the disconnect between the technology and the legal system, in that engineers are used to working rather distant from legal implications. You cannot ignore business and legal realities." Ethereum and other similar projects tie Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts, raising several legal issues that are both unclear and may be difficult to mitigate.

### World's First?

During the signing ceremony, the group wondered whether they were the first ever to execute a properly formed, legally binding, business Smart Contract. "I put word out there on various Cryptocurrency forums, asking whether there were any other who made the claim. That was a month ago... nobody has popped up to make the claim."

The group is however confident in claiming to be the first in Hong Kong to execute a Smart Contract according to formal legal standards. 

When asked why they signed it on paper rather than cryptographically, Dr Wang simply smiled and added: "Sometimes we appreciate the low-tech exercise of meeting up in person, shaking hands and signing it the old fashioned way. We pushed the boundaries of technology enough for today."
